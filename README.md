## modules
### atm4.v
this module is the first version which can be used to perform RTL simulation
### atm4_tb.v
this module is the tesbench for atm4.v module
### atm6.v
this module is the second version that we have designed to implement on the FPGA board.the code is same as atm4.v but with reduced number of pins so that it can be easily implemented on the target fpga board.
### atm6_tb.v 
this module is the testbench for atm6.v module.
